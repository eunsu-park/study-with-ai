# Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences - Overview

## Introduction

Systematic mathematical tools are essential for solving core problems in physics and engineering. This course is based on Mary L. Boas's *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences* and systematically covers the most frequently used mathematical methodologies in physical sciences.

Starting with infinite series and complex numbers, and proceeding through linear algebra, partial differentiation, vector analysis, Fourier analysis, differential equations, special functions, complex analysis, integral transforms, calculus of variations, and tensor analysis — we comprehensively cover the mathematical tools that form the theoretical foundation of modern physics and engineering.

Each lesson provides rigorous mathematical theory along with Python (NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib) implementations, enabling direct computation and visualization of abstract formulas.
