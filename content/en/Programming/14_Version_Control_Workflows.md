> **Objective**: Master branching strategies, code review practices, CI/CD fundamentals, and collaborative workflows for professional software development

## Introduction

Version control is the foundation of modern software development. It enables:
- **History tracking**: Every change is recorded with context
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Experimentation**: Try risky changes without fear
- **Rollback capability**: Undo mistakes easily
- **Code review**: Systematic quality gates before merging

This lesson covers **workflows**—the human processes built on top of version control tools—that make teams productive.

## Brief History of Version Control

Understanding the evolution helps appreciate why modern tools work the way they do:

1. **RCS (1982)**: Single-file locking, one developer at a time
2. **CVS (1986)**: Multi-file versioning, concurrent editing
3. **SVN/Subversion (2000)**: Centralized server, atomic commits, better binary handling
4. **Git (2005)**: Distributed, branching-first design, blazing fast
5. **Mercurial (2005)**: Distributed, simpler than Git, less adoption

**Key paradigm shift**: **Centralized** (SVN) → **Distributed** (Git)

### Centralized vs Distributed

**Centralized (SVN)**:
```
        Central Server
             |
     +-------+-------+
     |       |       |
  Dev A   Dev B   Dev C
```
- Single source of truth on server
- Commits require network connection
- Branches are expensive (full copy on server)

**Distributed (Git)**:
```
    Remote Repository (GitHub/GitLab)
             |
     +-------+-------+
     |       |       |
  Local   Local   Local
  Repo A  Repo B  Repo C
```
- Every developer has full history
- Commits are local (fast, offline-capable)
- Branches are cheap (pointers to commits)
- Push/pull synchronizes with remote

## Git Fundamentals (Quick Review)

Before diving into workflows, ensure you understand these concepts:

### Repository, Commit, Branch

```bash
# Repository: A .git folder containing all history
git init

# Commit: A snapshot of your project at a point in time
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# Branch: A movable pointer to a commit
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login  # or: git checkout -b feature-login
```

### The Three Trees

```
Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Repository
                 (git add)      (git commit)
```

```bash
# Modify file
echo "Hello" > file.txt

# Stage changes
git add file.txt

# Commit to repository
git commit -m "Add greeting"
```

### Merge vs Rebase

**Merge**: Combines branches, preserving history
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```
```
    A---B---C  main
         \   \
          D---E  feature-branch
```

**Rebase**: Replays commits on top of another branch, rewriting history
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
```
    A---B---C  main
             \
              D'---E'  feature-branch (rebased)
```

**When to use**:
- **Merge**: Public branches, preserving complete history
- **Rebase**: Private branches, cleaner linear history

## Branching Strategies

Branching strategies define **how teams organize code changes** to balance speed, stability, and collaboration.

### 1. Git Flow

**Git Flow** is a structured branching model with multiple long-lived branches.

**Branches**:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features (branch from develop)
- **release/**: Release preparation (branch from develop)
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes (branch from main)

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git commit -m "Add login form"
git commit -m "Add password validation"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Prepare release
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
# Fix bugs, update version numbers
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0

# Hotfix for production
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch
git commit -m "Fix CVE-2024-1234"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/security-patch
git tag v1.2.1
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/security-patch
```

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-suited for scheduled releases (e.g., monthly)
- Parallel development of features and releases

**Cons**:
- Complex with many branches
- Overhead for small teams or continuous deployment
- Merge conflicts can accumulate in develop

**Best for**: Traditional software with scheduled releases (quarterly, monthly).

### 2. GitHub Flow

**GitHub Flow** is a simplified workflow with one long-lived branch: `main`.

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b add-search-feature

# Make changes
git commit -m "Add search endpoint"
git commit -m "Add search UI"

# Push and open Pull Request
git push origin add-search-feature
# Open PR on GitHub

# After code review and CI passes, merge PR
# Delete branch
```

**Rules**:
1. `main` is always deployable
2. Create descriptive branch names (`fix-login-bug`, not `patch-1`)
3. Open PR early for discussion
4. Deploy from `main` after merge

**Pros**:
- Simple: one branch to track
- Fast iteration
- Works with continuous deployment

**Cons**:
- Requires robust CI/CD
- Feature flags needed for incomplete features in main
- Less structure for large teams

**Best for**: Web applications with continuous deployment, small to medium teams.

### 3. Trunk-Based Development

**Trunk-Based Development** emphasizes short-lived branches (< 1 day) and frequent integration.

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Small changes committed directly to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Make small change
git commit -m "Refactor user service"
git push origin main

# Larger changes use short-lived branches
git checkout -b refactor-database
# Work for a few hours
git commit -m "Extract repository pattern"
git push origin refactor-database
# Open PR, quick review, merge same day
```

**Rules**:
- Commit to `main` at least once per day
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
- No long-lived branches
- Rigorous automated testing

**Pros**:
- Minimizes merge conflicts (frequent integration)
- Encourages small, incremental changes
- Fast feedback loop

**Cons**:
- Requires mature CI/CD and testing
- Feature flags add complexity
- Risky without strong engineering discipline

**Best for**: High-performing teams, SaaS products with continuous deployment.

### Comparison Table

| Strategy | Branch Complexity | Release Cadence | Team Size | CI/CD Required |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Git Flow | High | Scheduled | Large | Moderate |
| GitHub Flow | Low | Continuous | Small/Medium | High |
| Trunk-Based | Very Low | Continuous | Any | Very High |

## Pull Requests / Merge Requests

**Pull Requests (PRs)** are a code review and discussion mechanism before merging.

### Anatomy of a Good PR

**1. Title**: Concise and descriptive
```
✅ Add user authentication with OAuth2
❌ Update code
```

**2. Description**: Context and testing instructions
```markdown
## Summary
Implements OAuth2 authentication flow using Google Sign-In.

## Changes
- Add OAuth2 client library
- Create login/callback routes
- Store user sessions in Redis
- Add authentication middleware

## Testing
1. Start Redis: `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis`
2. Set environment variables in `.env`
3. Visit `/login` and sign in with Google
4. Verify redirect to `/dashboard`

## Screenshots
[Screenshot of login flow]

## Related Issues
Closes #123
```

**3. Scope**: Small PRs get reviewed faster
```
✅ 50-200 lines: Quick review
⚠️ 200-500 lines: Takes time
❌ 1000+ lines: Avoid; split into multiple PRs
```

### Small PRs vs Large PRs

**Small PRs**:
- Easier to review (less cognitive load)
- Faster to merge (less context switching)
- Lower risk (limited blast radius)
- More frequent integration (fewer conflicts)

**Large PRs**:
- Review fatigue: Reviewers approve without careful reading
- Long-lived branches: Merge conflicts accumulate
- High risk: Big changes harder to revert

**Strategy**: Break work into incremental PRs:
```
❌ One PR: "Implement user dashboard" (1500 lines)

✅ Incremental PRs:
  1. "Add user model and database schema" (100 lines)
  2. "Add user service API" (150 lines)
  3. "Add dashboard UI" (200 lines)
  4. "Add dashboard data fetching" (100 lines)
```

## Code Review Best Practices

Code review is a **skill**. Both authors and reviewers must be thoughtful.

### What to Look For

**1. Correctness**: Does the code work?
- Logic errors
- Edge cases handling
- Error handling

**2. Design**: Is it well-structured?
- Separation of concerns
- Proper abstractions
- Design patterns usage

**3. Complexity**: Is it understandable?
- Overly clever code
- Missing comments for non-obvious logic

**4. Tests**: Is it properly tested?
- Test coverage for new code
- Tests for edge cases
- Tests are readable

**5. Security**: Are there vulnerabilities?
- SQL injection, XSS risks
- Secrets in code
- Authentication/authorization

**6. Performance**: Is it efficient?
- Unnecessary loops
- Inefficient database queries (N+1)
- Memory leaks

**7. Style**: Does it follow conventions?
- Naming conventions
- Code formatting
- Documentation

### Constructive Feedback

**Be kind and specific**:
```
❌ "This is wrong."
✅ "This function might throw an exception if `data` is null.
   Consider adding a null check on line 23."

❌ "Bad naming."
✅ "The variable name `d` is unclear. Consider renaming to
   `daysUntilExpiration` for clarity."
```

**Ask questions, don't demand**:
```
❌ "Change this to use a HashMap."
✅ "Could we use a HashMap here for O(1) lookups instead of O(n)?"
```

**Praise good work**:
```
✅ "Nice refactoring! This is much more readable."
✅ "Great test coverage on edge cases."
```

### Automate What You Can

Don't waste human time on what machines can check:

- **Linters**: `eslint`, `pylint`, `rubocop`
- **Formatters**: `prettier`, `black`, `gofmt`
- **Type checkers**: `TypeScript`, `mypy`, `Flow`
- **Security scanners**: `Snyk`, `Dependabot`

Configure these to run automatically in CI.

### Code Review Checklist

Create a team-specific checklist:
```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

### Functionality
- [ ] Code works as intended
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

### Tests
- [ ] New code has tests
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] Tests pass locally

### Design
- [ ] Code is modular and follows SOLID principles
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] Authorization checks are correct

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs are documented
- [ ] README is updated (if needed)
```

## Merge Strategies

When merging a PR, you have three options:

### 1. Merge Commit

Creates a merge commit preserving full history:
```
    A---B---C  main
         \   \
          D---E  feature (merge commit at F)
               \
                F  main (after merge)
```

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

**Pros**: Full history preserved, easy to revert entire feature
**Cons**: Cluttered history with many merge commits

### 2. Squash and Merge

Combines all feature commits into one:
```
    A---B---C---D  main
         \
          E---F---G  feature (squashed into D)
```

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature-branch
git commit -m "Add feature X (squashed)"
```

**Pros**: Clean linear history, one commit per feature
**Cons**: Loses individual commit history, harder to bisect

### 3. Rebase and Merge

Replays commits on top of main:
```
    A---B---C  main
             \
              D'---E'  feature (rebased)
```

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch  # Fast-forward merge
```

**Pros**: Linear history, preserves individual commits
**Cons**: Rewrites history (don't rebase public branches)

### Recommendation

- **Squash**: For small features, bug fixes (most common)
- **Rebase**: For well-structured commits worth preserving
- **Merge commit**: For large features, release branches

## CI/CD Fundamentals

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test code on every push.
**Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Keep main branch always deployable.
**Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploy to production after tests pass.

### CI Pipeline Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (GitHub Actions)
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run security scan
        run: npm audit
```

### CD Pipeline Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Push to registry
        run: docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

### Pipeline Stages

Typical stages in order:
1. **Checkout code**: Clone repository
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`, `pip install`
3. **Lint**: Check code style
4. **Test**: Run unit, integration tests
5. **Security scan**: Check for vulnerabilities
6. **Build**: Compile, bundle
7. **Deploy**: Push to staging/production

**Fast feedback**: Fail fast—run quick checks (lint) before slow ones (E2E tests).

## Monorepo vs Polyrepo

### Monorepo

**One repository for all projects**:
```
company-repo/
├── services/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── worker/
├── libraries/
│   ├── shared-utils/
│   └── ui-components/
└── tools/
```

**Pros**:
- Atomic cross-project changes
- Code sharing is easy
- Single CI/CD configuration
- Simplified dependency management

**Cons**:
- Large repository (clone, checkout slower)
- CI runs for unrelated changes
- Requires tooling (Bazel, Nx, Turborepo)

**Used by**: Google, Facebook, Microsoft

### Polyrepo

**Separate repository for each project**:
```
company-api/
company-frontend/
company-worker/
shared-utils/
ui-components/
```

**Pros**:
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Faster clones
- Targeted CI (only affected repo)

**Cons**:
- Cross-repo changes are painful
- Dependency version hell
- Code duplication

**Used by**: Most small/medium companies

### Recommendation

- **Monorepo**: If projects are tightly coupled, frequent cross-project changes
- **Polyrepo**: If projects are independent microservices

## Semantic Versioning

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** communicates the nature of changes via version numbers:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  2  . 3   . 1
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
- **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

**Examples**:
- `1.0.0 → 1.0.1`: Bug fix
- `1.0.1 → 1.1.0`: New feature added
- `1.1.0 → 2.0.0`: Breaking change (API changed)

**Pre-release versions**:
- `1.0.0-alpha.1`: Alpha release
- `1.0.0-beta.2`: Beta release
- `1.0.0-rc.1`: Release candidate

## Commit Message Conventions

Good commit messages enable:
- Quick understanding of changes
- Automated changelog generation
- Easy navigation of history

### Conventional Commits

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting (no code change)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Tooling, dependencies

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login

Implement Google Sign-In flow using OAuth2.
Users can now log in with their Google accounts.

Closes #123

---

fix(api): handle null user IDs in getUser endpoint

Previously, null IDs caused a 500 error.
Now returns 400 Bad Request with error message.

---

docs(readme): update installation instructions

---

refactor(db): extract repository pattern

Move database logic from services to repositories
for better separation of concerns.
```

### Writing Meaningful Messages

**Bad**:
```
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update code"
git commit -m "changes"
```

**Good**:
```
git commit -m "fix: prevent race condition in user registration"
git commit -m "refactor: extract email validation to utility function"
git commit -m "feat: add pagination to user list endpoint"
```

**Tips**:
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- First line: concise summary (50 chars)
- Body: explain **why**, not what (code shows what)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Choose a Branching Strategy

You're leading a team with these characteristics:
- 5 developers
- Web application deployed to Heroku
- Deploys multiple times per day
- Feature flags are used for incomplete features

Which branching strategy would you recommend? Justify your choice.

### Exercise 2: Write a Code Review Checklist

Create a code review checklist for a Python web API project using Flask and PostgreSQL. Include at least 10 items covering functionality, security, performance, and style.

### Exercise 3: Design a CI/CD Pipeline

Design a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application that:
1. Runs on every push to any branch
2. Runs linting, tests, and security scans
3. Builds a Docker image
4. Deploys to staging on pushes to `main`
5. Deploys to production on git tags (`v*`)

Write the pipeline configuration in YAML (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).

### Exercise 4: Evaluate PR Quality

Evaluate this pull request and provide feedback:

**Title**: "Update user stuff"
**Description**: (empty)
**Changes**: 45 files changed, 2,300 lines added, 800 deleted
**Commits**: 37 commits with messages like "wip", "fix", "more changes"

What are the problems? How should the author improve it?

### Exercise 5: Semantic Versioning

Your API currently is at version `2.3.5`. Decide the next version number for each scenario:

1. You fixed a bug in the authentication middleware
2. You added a new optional parameter to an existing endpoint
3. You removed a deprecated endpoint
4. You improved internal caching (no API changes)
5. You renamed a field in the JSON response from `user_name` to `username`

## Summary

Effective version control workflows enable teams to move fast without breaking things:

- **Branching Strategies**: Git Flow (structured), GitHub Flow (simple), Trunk-Based (rapid)
- **Pull Requests**: Small, focused PRs with clear descriptions get reviewed faster
- **Code Review**: Be constructive, automate style checks, focus on design and correctness
- **Merge Strategies**: Squash (clean history), rebase (preserve commits), merge (full history)
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment reduce human error and accelerate delivery
- **Monorepo vs Polyrepo**: Monorepo for tight coupling, polyrepo for independence
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH communicates impact of changes
- **Commit Messages**: Conventional Commits enable automation and clarity

Great workflows balance **speed** (ship features quickly) and **quality** (avoid bugs, maintain codebase).
