# Subqueries and CTE

## 1. What is a Subquery?

A subquery is another query contained within a query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);  -- Subquery
          ↑
    Query in parentheses
```

---

## 2. WHERE Clause Subqueries

### Scalar Subquery (Single Value)

```sql
-- Products more expensive than average
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);

-- Orders on the latest order date
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date = (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders);
```

### Multi-Row Subquery

```sql
-- Users who have ordered
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM orders);

-- Users who purchased electronics
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT o.user_id FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
    WHERE p.category = 'Electronics'
);
```

### NOT IN

```sql
-- Users who have never ordered
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
);
-- Caution: NOT IN with NULL may return empty results
```

### ANY / SOME

```sql
-- Furniture more expensive than any electronics item
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Furniture'
  AND price > ANY (SELECT price FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics');
-- = ANY is same as IN
```

### ALL

```sql
-- Products more expensive than all electronics items
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > ALL (SELECT price FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics');
```

---

## 3. EXISTS / NOT EXISTS

Checks only for row existence.

```sql
-- Users with orders
SELECT * FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id
);

-- Users without orders
SELECT * FROM users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id
);
```

### IN vs EXISTS

```sql
-- IN: Load subquery results into memory
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);

-- EXISTS: Check existence for each row
SELECT * FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id);

-- Generally:
-- - Use IN if subquery results are small
-- - Use EXISTS if subquery results are large
-- - Prefer NOT EXISTS over NOT IN (avoid NULL issues)
```

---

## 4. FROM Clause Subquery (Inline View)

```sql
-- Calculate average price by category, then filter
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category
) AS category_avg
WHERE avg_price > 100000;

-- Alias required for subquery (AS category_avg)
```

### JOIN After Complex Aggregation

```sql
-- Combine user stats with user info
SELECT
    u.name,
    u.email,
    stats.order_count,
    stats.total_amount
FROM users u
JOIN (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS stats ON u.id = stats.user_id;
```

---

## 5. SELECT Clause Subquery (Scalar Subquery)

```sql
-- Display each product with category average price
SELECT
    name,
    price,
    (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products p2 WHERE p2.category = p.category) AS category_avg
FROM products p;

-- Order count for each user
SELECT
    u.name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id) AS order_count
FROM users u;
```

---

## 6. Correlated Subquery

A subquery that references values from the outer query.

```sql
-- Products more expensive than their category average
SELECT * FROM products p
WHERE price > (
    SELECT AVG(price) FROM products WHERE category = p.category
);
--                                                    ↑ Reference outer query

-- Most expensive product in each category
SELECT * FROM products p
WHERE price = (
    SELECT MAX(price) FROM products WHERE category = p.category
);
```

---

## 7. CTE (Common Table Expression)

Uses WITH clause to name temporary result sets.

### Basic CTE

```sql
-- Subquery approach
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category
) AS category_stats
WHERE avg_price > 100000;

-- CTE approach (more readable)
WITH category_stats AS (
    SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category
)
SELECT * FROM category_stats
WHERE avg_price > 100000;
```

### Multiple CTEs

```sql
WITH
-- Category statistics
category_stats AS (
    SELECT
        category,
        COUNT(*) AS product_count,
        AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category
),
-- Expensive products (1,000,000+)
expensive_products AS (
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE price >= 1000000
)
SELECT
    cs.category,
    cs.product_count,
    cs.avg_price,
    COUNT(ep.id) AS expensive_count
FROM category_stats cs
LEFT JOIN expensive_products ep ON cs.category = ep.category
GROUP BY cs.category, cs.product_count, cs.avg_price;
```

### CTE with Main Query

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
        SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
)
SELECT
    month,
    total,
    LAG(total) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month,
    total - LAG(total) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS diff
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month;
```

---

## 8. Recursive CTE (WITH RECURSIVE)

A CTE that references itself.

### Organization Chart Traversal

```sql
-- Employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id)
);

INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id) VALUES
('CEO', NULL),
('CTO', 1),
('Dev Manager', 2),
('Developer A', 3),
('Developer B', 3),
('CFO', 1),
('Finance Manager', 6);

-- Query all subordinates from CEO
WITH RECURSIVE org_tree AS (
    -- Base case: CEO
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level, name::TEXT AS path
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: subordinates
    SELECT
        e.id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        ot.level + 1,
        ot.path || ' > ' || e.name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_tree ot ON e.manager_id = ot.id
)
SELECT
    REPEAT('  ', level - 1) || name AS org_chart,
    level,
    path
FROM org_tree
ORDER BY path;
```

Result:
```
     org_chart      │ level │           path
────────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────
 CEO                │     1 │ CEO
   CFO              │     2 │ CEO > CFO
     Finance Manager│     3 │ CEO > CFO > Finance Manager
   CTO              │     2 │ CEO > CTO
     Dev Manager    │     3 │ CEO > CTO > Dev Manager
       Developer A  │     4 │ CEO > CTO > Dev Manager > Developer A
       Developer B  │     4 │ CEO > CTO > Dev Manager > Developer B
```

### Generate Number Sequence

```sql
-- 1 to 10
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT * FROM numbers;
```

### Generate Date Range

```sql
-- Last 7 days
WITH RECURSIVE date_range AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 days' AS date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT date + INTERVAL '1 day'
    FROM date_range
    WHERE date < CURRENT_DATE
)
SELECT date::DATE FROM date_range;
```

## 9. Practice Examples

### Sample Data

```sql
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO departments (name) VALUES
('Development'), ('Marketing'), ('HR'), ('Finance');

INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, salary, hire_date) VALUES
('Kim Dev', 1, 5000000, '2020-03-15'),
('Lee Dev', 1, 4500000, '2021-06-20'),
('Park Marketing', 2, 4000000, '2019-11-10'),
('Choi Marketing', 2, 3800000, '2022-01-05'),
('Jung HR', 3, 3500000, '2020-08-25'),
('Han Finance', 4, 4200000, '2021-03-10'),
('Oh Finance', 4, 3900000, '2022-07-15');
```

### Practice 1: WHERE Subqueries

```sql
-- 1. Employees with salary higher than average
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- 2. Most recently hired employee
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employees);

-- 3. Employees in Development or Marketing
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name IN ('Development', 'Marketing')
);
```

### Practice 2: Correlated Subqueries

```sql
-- 1. Employees with salary higher than their department average
SELECT
    e.name,
    e.salary,
    d.name AS department
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);

-- 2. Highest paid employee in each department
SELECT * FROM employees e
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);
```

### Practice 3: CTE Usage

```sql
-- 1. Query employee info with department stats
WITH dept_stats AS (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
        COUNT(*) AS emp_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT
    e.name,
    e.salary,
    d.name AS department,
    ds.avg_salary AS dept_avg,
    ds.emp_count AS dept_count
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
JOIN dept_stats ds ON e.department_id = ds.department_id;

-- 2. Query with salary ranking
WITH ranked_employees AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
    FROM employees
)
SELECT
    name,
    salary,
    salary_rank AS overall_rank,
    dept_rank AS dept_rank
FROM ranked_employees
ORDER BY salary_rank;
```

### Practice 4: Complex Usage

```sql
-- Employees with above-average salary in their department and the difference
WITH
dept_avg AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
),
above_avg AS (
    SELECT
        e.*,
        da.avg_salary,
        e.salary - da.avg_salary AS diff
    FROM employees e
    JOIN dept_avg da ON e.department_id = da.department_id
    WHERE e.salary >= da.avg_salary
)
SELECT
    aa.name,
    d.name AS department,
    aa.salary,
    ROUND(aa.avg_salary, 0) AS dept_avg,
    ROUND(aa.diff, 0) AS above_avg_by
FROM above_avg aa
JOIN departments d ON aa.department_id = d.id
ORDER BY aa.diff DESC;
```
