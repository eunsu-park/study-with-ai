## Course Features

### Balance Between Theory and Practice
Each lesson provides mathematical proofs along with Python implementations. You can build intuition by not just looking at formulas but implementing and visualizing them in code.

### ML/DL-Centric Approach
The focus is on how mathematics is actually used in machine learning and deep learning, not abstract mathematics. For example, when learning eigenvalue decomposition, we also cover applications like PCA and spectral clustering.

### Modern Topics Included
Beyond traditional mathematics courses, we cover the mathematical foundations of cutting-edge AI models like Transformers, diffusion models, and graph neural networks.

### Emphasis on Visualization
Rich visualizations using Matplotlib are provided to understand abstract concepts. Even high-dimensional space concepts can be intuitively understood through 2D/3D visualization.

## Learning Strategies

### 1. Derive Formulas by Hand
Don't just read formulas in papers or textbooks—write them down on paper and derive them step by step. Where you get stuck is exactly your learning point.

### 2. Validate with Code
After deriving a formula, always implement it in code to verify the results. You can confirm the meaning of the formula through numerical examples.

### 3. Build Intuition Through Visualization
Even high-dimensional data or complex functions can be visualized through appropriate cross-sections or projections. Understand the geometric meaning of mathematical concepts while creating graphs.

### 4. Practice Problems Are Essential
Don't skip the practice problems in each lesson. Even if you think you understand the concept, you can only verify true understanding by solving problems.

### 5. Practice Reading Papers
When you reach Phase 4, select an AI paper of interest and intensively analyze the formula sections. This is good practice for applying learned mathematics in real situations.
